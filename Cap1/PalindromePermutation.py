'''
Given a string, write a function to check if it is a permutation of a palinÂ­drome. 
A palindrome is a word or phrase that is the same forwards and backwards. A permutation is a rearrangement of letters. 
The palindrome does not need to be limited to just dictionary words.
'''

# If a palindrome has pair length, all the characters must to be in pair quantities.
# If a palindrome has odd length, there is only one character with odd quantity 
# and the others must to be in a pair quantities.

# Also we have that in a pair length palindrome, we have the same characters in same quantity in both halves 
# of the string. In addition, for an odd length palindrome, we need to have in the middle of the string the character in 
# odd quantity and since this character the left and right middle have the same chars in same quantities.

def PalindromePermutation(string_: str) -> bool:

    chars_quantity = {}
    # Save the quantity for every char in the string
    for char in string_.replace(" ", "").lower():
        if char in chars_quantity.keys():
            chars_quantity[char] += 1
        else:

    for char, quantity in chars_quantity.items():

            odd_chars += 1
        if odd_chars > 1:
